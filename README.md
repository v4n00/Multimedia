# Multimedia

This Github repo contains all of the websites that I built during my "Multimedia" class in university. I have upgraded them from the basic version we did in class to something I would call "pretty" ðŸ’Ž.

Also I had a project for this class that can be found [here](https://github.com/v4n00/interactive-soundboard/).
